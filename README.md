# How to use our data and run WikiNet
Navigate to the `colab_starter_pack` directory. This folder contains a `.zip` of our processed graph with node features, the corresponding navigation path + label `.tsv` data, and a `.ipynb` containing the necessary code to load, run, and evaluate our RNN-GNN hybrid model. Check out our [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1geXYFIopoh7W4bLFrICqdkh1HuVySLQn?usp=sharing) and our [Medium post](https://medium.com/stanford-cs224w/wikinet-an-experiment-in-recurrent-graph-neural-networks-3f149676fbf3) for a fuller write-up on this experiment.
